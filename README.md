Data Analysis: Pandas 

I wish, I could write a 3 repositories...
1. Data Analysis with Excel
2. Data Analysis with SQL
3. Data Analysis with Python

IT is accelerating in such a fast pace, mostly no one cares about excel or sql anymore where big data is almost taking over. I am focusing on python for this repository where I will be exploring few libraries like Pandas, Numpy...
